# Vitura | Senior Fullstack (React/Node.js) Assessment - Q1 2025

## Run the Project
 - Backend (api) the folder name is api
 - Frontend the folder name is frontend

 pull from git git@github.com:uniraymond/vitura-senior-react-nodejs-assesment-08-2025.git
 it is under develop branch

 unzip the download file

 cd frontend
 npm install
 npm run build
 npm run dev

 cd api
 npm install
 npm run build
 npm run dev

 the frontend url should be http://localhost:5051

 the api url should be http://localhost:5050

 if frontend can't load the products, rerun the api "npm run dev" again

 under api folder to do the jest test

 npm run test

## Overview
Build a small fullstack app: a Node.js API that serves products and a simple React UI that consumes it. The solution should reflect standard practices with Node.js, Express, and React with TypeScript. Use async throughout. Keep setup minimal and focus on senior-level judgement.

**Timebox:** Aim for under three hours. Stop at three hours and note what remains.

## What You Will Build
- Backend: Node.js API with one endpoint `GET /products`
- Frontend: React single-page app that calls the API
- Data: load `sample-products.json` in memory at startup (no database)

## Dataset
Use the provided [`sample-products.json`](https://github.com/mjkearns/vitura-senior-react-nodejs-assesment-08-2025/blob/main/sample-products.json) with 120 realistic products across multiple categories and brands. Load it in memory at startup. Do not add a database.

## Functional Requirements
- **Backend**
  - Endpoint: `GET /products`
  - Query params:
    - `view` in `{admin,doctor}` (controls visibility)
    - `q` (text search on `publicName`)
    - `new` in `{true,false}` (created in last 30 days)
  - Return only fields required by the frontend
  - Implement as async and support cancellation
- **Frontend**
  - Show a list of products from the API
  - Controls:
    - Search box for `publicName`
    - Toggle between `admin` and `doctor` views
    - Optional: filter to show only "new" products

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Middleware**
  - Central error handler with consistent JSON response
  - Request logging middleware with method, path, duration, status, and item count
- **Config**
  - Use environment variables for config (eg: port, default view)
  - Include a `.env.example` in your repo
- **Logging**
  - Logs should be structured and concise
- **TypeScript**
  - Enable `strict`
  - Define a `Product` type for both backend and frontend
  - Avoid `any`
- **Frontend polish**
  - Inputs should be accessible (labels, focus)
  - Provide loading and empty states
  - Debounce search requests so the API is not spammed

## Testing
Provide one focused test only:
- EITHER backend filter logic (`new` or `view`)
- OR a React component test (eg: "New" filter shows only items created in last 30 days)

## Deliverables
A **GitHub repo** that contains:
- Node.js backend project (TypeScript)
- React frontend project (TypeScript)
- Async implementation with middleware for errors, logging, and validation
- `sample-products.json` loaded at startup
- One focused test (backend or frontend)
- **README** that covers:
  - How to run locally
  - State management choice and why
  - Trade-offs made due to time limit and what you would do next
  - What you would do differently in production (eg: database indexing, caching, auth)

## What To Ignore
- Authentication/authorisation
- Routing beyond a single page
- Pagination or complex tabs
- Heavy styling or design systems
- Database setup

## Evaluation Rubric (0â€“4 each, total 20)
- **Correctness** - spec met and edge cases handled
- **Code quality** - clear structure, naming, cohesion
- **Test** - targeted and easy to run
- **Senior judgement** - sensible defaults, trade-offs, ops thinking
- **Developer experience** - README clarity, simple startup, useful logs

## Getting Started
- Use Express for the backend
- Use React with Vite or Create React App
- Use TypeScript on both backend and frontend
- Keep it small, async, and readable
